This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependecies using the command:

npm install

make sure to use node v18.16.0 

run the development server:

npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
## What did I do

I started the project using create-next-app. For the styling I used Styled Components. I decided to leave everything componetized to make the code easier to maintain. I organized the code keeping an index.tsx file for the component creation and the styling in a style.ts file. I had some problems with styled components in next, where the css wasn't rendered when loading the page, but I fixed it by tweaking the next.config.js file. I adjusted the responsiveness to make the page viewable on mobile.

## Deploy on Vercel

The project was deployed with vercel. It's available on https://leadster.mvalentim.dev .
